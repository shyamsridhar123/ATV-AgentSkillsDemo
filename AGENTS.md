# Agent Instructions

This project uses a **dual tracking system**:

| Tool | Audience | Purpose |
|------|----------|---------|
| [beads](https://github.com/steveyegge/beads) (`bd`) | Agents | Active work, dependencies, blockers, structured memory |
| [Backlog.md](Backlog.md) | Humans | Completed work archive, decisions, readable changelog |

**The rule:** beads is always current. Backlog.md gets updated when work completes.

## Quick Setup

```bash
# Install beads
curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/steveyegge/beads/main/scripts/install.sh | bash

# Initialize in your project
bd init

# Run doctor to verify setup
bd doctor
```

## Quick Reference

```bash
# Simple task
bd create "Issue title" --description="What needs to be done" -l in_progress

# Epic for complex work
bd create "Feature name" --type epic -p 1

# Subtask with parent
bd create "Subtask" --parent <epic-id>

# Task with dependency
bd create "Blocked task" --deps "<blocker-id>"

# List issues / see what's ready
bd list
bd ready

# View dependencies
bd dep tree <id>

# Close an issue
bd close <id>
```

## Workflow

### Simple Tasks
1. `bd create "Task" -l in_progress`
2. Do the work
3. `bd close <id>`
4. Update Backlog.md if significant
5. Commit and push

### Complex Work (Multi-Agent)
1. `bd create "Feature" --type epic -p 1`
2. **Create/checkout** the epic branch from main:

   ```bash
   git fetch origin main
   git checkout -b epic/<epic-id> origin/main
   ```

3. Break into subtasks with `--parent` and `--deps`
4. `bd ready` to find unblocked work
5. Route to specialists with issue IDs **and branch name**
6. Close subtasks as they complete
7. `bd epic close-eligible` when all children done
8. Update Backlog.md with summary
9. Push the epic branch
10. **Create a PR to `main`** using GitHub MCP (`mcp_github2_create_pull_request`)

## Landing the Plane (Session Completion)

**When ending a work session**, you MUST complete ALL steps below. Work is NOT complete until `git push` succeeds AND the PR is created.

**MANDATORY WORKFLOW:**

1. **Close beads issues** - `bd close <id>` for completed work
2. **Create follow-up issues** - `bd create` for any remaining work
3. **Update Backlog.md** - Add summary to Completed section for significant work
4. **Run quality gates** (if code changed) - Tests, linters, builds
5. **PUSH TO EPIC BRANCH** - This is MANDATORY:

   ```bash
   git add -A
   git commit -m "<epic-id>: description of work"
   git pull origin "epic/<epic-id>" --rebase
   git push origin "epic/<epic-id>"
   git status  # MUST show "up to date with origin"
   ```

6. **CREATE A PR TO `main`** - Use GitHub MCP to create a pull request:

   ```text
   mcp_github2_create_pull_request(
     owner: <repo-owner>,
     repo: <repo-name>,
     title: "<epic-id>: <summary of work>",
     head: "epic/<epic-id>",
     base: "main",
     body: "## Summary\n<what was done>\n\n## Epic\n<epic-id>\n\n## Changes\n<list of changes>",
     draft: false
   )
   ```

7. **Share the PR link** with the user
8. **Hand off** - Provide context for next session including the epic ID, branch, and PR URL

**CRITICAL RULES:**

- Work is NOT complete until `git push` succeeds AND the PR is created
- NEVER stop before pushing - that leaves work stranded locally
- NEVER say "ready to push when you are" - YOU must push
- If push fails, resolve and retry until it succeeds
- The PR is how humans review your work. No PR = no review = no trust.
